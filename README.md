# REX: A Declarative Regular Expression Language

Authors: Eric Hernandez and Tai Danh

## Overview

For our final project, we decided to build **REX**: a declarative regular expression language, with SQL-like syntax. The language supports the basic regular expression operators *union*, *concatenation*, and *star repeat*. The project will go public very soon!

## Motivation

The idea for our project came after one of the early CSE 211 lectures that discussed parsers and parser generators. In the lecture, we discussed regular expressions, the syntax of regular expressions, and parsing with derivatives. As we discussed the lecture after class, we noted the difficulty of parsing very large and intricate regular expression patterns with the naked eye. We thought of SQL, which at times can almost feel like you are speaking a natural language, and we thought that maybe bringing that aspect and creating a declarative regular expression language would ease the difficulty of mentally parsing intricate regular expression patterns.

## Setting Up REX

From the beginning, we decided to build the entirety of REX using the Rust Programming Language. We chose Rust for the commodity of safety that it brings to memory management and the speed. You also can't forget the commodity of a crate being somewhere out there for just about anything you can think of.
